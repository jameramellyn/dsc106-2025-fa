## Submission

To get checked off for the lab, please record a 1 minute video in mp4 format with the following components **in the following order**:

1. Present your Mapbox visualization.
2. Show yourself interacting with your map visualizations with ALL features and functionalities this lab delineates.
3. Share the most interesting thing you learned from this lab.

**Videos longer than 1 minute will be trimmed to 1 minute before we grade, so
make sure your video is 1 minute or less.**

## What will we make?

In this lab, we will be building an immersive, interactive map visualization of bike traffic in the Boston area during different times of the day, shown in the video below:

<video src="videos/final.mp4" loop muted autoplay class="browser"></video>

- The underlying map shows Boston area roads and labels of neighborhoods. You can pan and zoom around as you would with services like Google Maps.
- The green lines show bike lanes. We will be importing two datasets from the city governments of Boston and Cambridge for this.
- The circles represent individual BlueBike stations. The size of each circle represents the amount of traffic at each station, while the color represents whether most traffic is entering or leaving the station. We will be using two datasets from BlueBikes to analyze bike traffic from about 260,000 individual rides from March 2024.
- There is a slider at the top right that allows the user to filter the data for traffic at specific times of the day, and the circles will change size and color accordingly.

There is a lot of room for styling and customization in this lab, and you are free to choose colors and themes that you prefer. So the screenshots and videos here are for reference only and your version can differ in appearance (but should be functionally the same!).

## Step 0: Start a new Project

### Step 0.1: Create a new repository and push it to GitHub

In this lab, we will be working on a new project and thus a new repository (that we will subsequently list on our projects page).
Follow [part 2 step 1-2 of lab 1](../lab01/) again to set up a new Website with a new repo name this time. I called mine `bikewatching`, but you may want to get more creative with bike-related puns. You don't have to worry about the content of your index.html here, we will update that soon! 😉

### Step 0.2: Publish your new project to GitHub Pages

Also follow [part 2 step 3 from the same lab](../lab01/) to set up GitHub Pages for your new project.

<!-- ### Step 0.3: Start local server

Run `npm run dev --open` to start the local server and open the project in your browser.

### Step 0.4: Edit `routes/+page.svelte`

Replace the content of `routes/+page.svelte` with a heading of your project name and a brief description of what it does.
Commit and push the change, and make sure the website updates accordingly.

### Step 0.5: Add basic styling

Create a CSS file for global styles in `src/lib` called `global.css` and add the following content:

```css
body {
  font: 100%/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
  max-width: 80em;
  min-height: 100vh;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

Then, in your `src/routes/+page.svelte` file, import the CSS file by adding this in a `<style>` element:

```css
@import url('$lib/global.css');
``` -->

### Step 0.3: Edit `index.html`

Open the `index.html` file located in your project root directory. Replace the content inside the `<body>` tag with a heading of your project name and a brief description of what it does.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Bikewatching</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>🚴🏼‍♀️ Bikewatching</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Commit and push the change:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add project name and description"
git push
```

Ensure the website updates accordingly on GitHub Pages.

### Step 0.4: Add basic styling

Create a CSS file for global styles called `global.css` and add the following content:

```css
body {
  font: 100%/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
  max-width: 80em;
  min-height: 100vh;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

Make sure the CSS file is linked in your `index.html` file (as shown in **Step 0.4**) via:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="global.css" />
```

### Step 0.5: Add a Bike Favicon

To make your project tabs stand out in the browser, you can customize the _[favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon)_.

1. **Add the Favicon File**:

   In your project directory, create a folder called `assets`, and inside it, add a file named `favicon.svg` with the following content:

   ```xml
   <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
     <text y=".9em" font-size="90">🚴🏼‍♀️</text>
   </svg>
   ```

   Feel free to replace the emoji with any other of your choice.

2. **Edit `index.html` to Link the Favicon**:

   Open your `index.html` file and add (or update) the following line inside the `<head>` section to point to your new favicon:

   ```html
   <link rel="icon" href="assets/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
   ```

At this point, you should be seeing something like this:

<img src="images/step-0.png" class="browser" alt="">

and your browser tab should have the bike icon as well (assuming that's the emoji you selected!)

## Step 1: My first map

### Step 1.0: Create a Mapbox account

Go to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and create an account [using your UCSD email](https://www.mapbox.com/community/education). Once you do this, you will have to enter your address for "billing" but we will be using the free service tier which carries no charge.

<!-- , but you still need to provide credit card information during the signup process (please reach out to the course staff if that may be a problem). Otherwise, the process of signing up should be straightforward. -->

After you sign up, make sure to verify your email.

### Step 1.1: Add Mapbox GL JS to Your Project

We'll use **CDN links** to include Mapbox GL JS directly in our HTML.

1. **Add the following to the `<head>` of your `index.html`:**

   ```html
   <!-- Mapbox GL JS CSS -->
   <link
     href="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v2.15.0/mapbox-gl.css"
     rel="stylesheet"
   />
   ```

2. We then **import Mapbox GL JS as an ES module directly in a new `map.js` file**:

Firstly, create a file called `map.js` in your repo. Add the following import statement:

```javascript
// Import Mapbox as an ESM module
import mapboxgl from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mapbox-gl@2.15.0/+esm';
```

2. **Link `map.js` in `index.html`**

Add this inside the `<head>` of your`index.html`:

```html
<script src="map.js" type="module"></script>
```

This ensures your JavaScript file loads correctly as an **ES module**.

3. **Verify Mapbox GL JS in Console**

In your `map.js` file, add this line:

```javascript
// Check that Mapbox GL JS is loaded
console.log('Mapbox GL JS Loaded:', mapboxgl);
```

Then, check your console:

- Open your browser’s **Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)**
- Go to the **Console** tab
- If Mapbox is properly loaded, you should see an object logged.
- If you see an error, double-check your **script import** in `index.html`.

### Step 1.2: Add an Element to Hold the Map

1. **In your `index.html`, add a `div` to contain the map:**

   ```html
   <div id="map"></div>
   ```

2. **Add basic CSS to ensure the map fills the screen:**

   Create a `map.css` file and link it to your html file with the following content (you can add more style to it if you like ):

   ```css
   html,
   body {
     margin: 0;
     padding: 5;
     height: 100%;
     width: 100%;
     display: flex;
     justify-content: center; /* Center horizontally */
     align-items: center; /* Center vertically */
   }

   #map {
     width: 100%; /* Adjust width to your desired size */
     height: 100%; /* Adjust height to your desired size */
     box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Optional: subtle shadow for effect */
     border-radius: 8px; /* Optional: rounded corners */
   }
   ```

<!-- ### Step 1.1: Install Mapbox.js

In your project directory, run the following command to install the Mapbox.js library:

```bash
npm install mapbox-gl
```

### Step 1.2: Add an element to hold the map

We will largely follow the steps outlined in [Mapbox’s official docs about Svelte integration](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-svelte/).

Let’s create an element to receive our map and bind it to a variable (we’ll need to reference that when we tell Mapbox to create a map there):

```html
<div id="map" />
```

We also want to add some CSS to ensure the map will have sufficient height:

```css
#map {
  flex: 1;
}
```

Try giving the map a background color to make sure it’s taking up the space you expect:

<img src="images/map-empty.png" class="browser" alt="">

### Step 1.3: Import Mapbox and connect it to our account

In order to use Mapbox, we first need to import its JS and CSS.
In your `src/routes/+page.svelte` file, inside your `<script>` tag, add this:

```javascript
import mapboxgl from 'mapbox-gl';
import '../../node_modules/mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl.css';
```


{: .tbd }
There is actually a named export `mapbox-gl/style` but I could not get it to work at all.


Then, we need to connect our account to it, by setting up our access token:

```js
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'your access token here';
```

To find your access token, you go to your account page on Mapbox:

<img src="images/access-token.png" class="browser">

{: .warning }
Make sure your repo is private before you push your access token to GitHub! -->

### Step 1.3: Create the map

To create the map, we create a new `mapboxgl.Map` object with [settings](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/) that specify things like:

- which HTML element will hold the map? (`container`) This can be either an element reference, or a string with the element’s ID (which is what we will use)
- What will the _basemap_ look like? (`style`)
- _Map extent_:
  - What latitude and longitude will the map be centered on? (`center: [longitude, latitude]`)
  - How zoomed in will the map start off and what will be the min & max zoom allowed? (`zoom`, `minZoom`, `maxZoom`)

Here is some sample code on how to instantiate a `mapboxgl.Map` object:

```js
// Set your Mapbox access token here
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE';

// Initialize the map
const map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  container: 'map', // ID of the div where the map will render
  style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12', // Map style
  center: [-71.09415, 42.36027], // [longitude, latitude]
  zoom: 12, // Initial zoom level
  minZoom: 5, // Minimum allowed zoom
  maxZoom: 18, // Maximum allowed zoom
});
```

**Find Your Access Token**

1. Go to your [Mapbox Account Dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/).
2. Copy your **default public access token** (it starts with `pk.`).
3. Replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'` in `map.js` with your actual token:

```js
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'pk.your_actual_mapbox_access_token_here';
```

In terms of what values to apply to options:

- For the container, we want to specify an id so we don't have to worry about element references.
- For the style, I used `"mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12"` but you are welcome to choose any [other style](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/#classic-mapbox-styles) you like. Keep in mind that the busier the style, the harder it will be to see your data drawn on top of it.
- Map extent:
  - I used `12` for the zoom level (`zoom`)
  - You can use any centerpoint you like, but it should be within the Cambridge & Boston area. See below for how to find the latitude and longitude of any location.

To find the coordinates of a location, you can enter it on Google Maps, and then right click and select the first option:

![](images/gps-copy.png)

Another way is via the URL, it's the part after the `@`:
![](images/gmaps-latlng.png)

Note that you will need to specify them in the reverse order, as [Mapbox expects longitude first](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/#coordinate-format).

If everything went well, you should have a map of Boston already!

<img src="images/step-1.png" class="browser" alt="">

Try panning and zooming around to see the map in action.

### Step 1.5: Customizing the map _(optional)_

The map style in its current form is quite functional as it shows a lot of useful waypoints and detail.
However, sometimes we'd like to create a more stylized map to create a cohesive design language across our website, or simply to draw readers in with a unique design.

Luckily, Mapbox provides a way to fully customize your map style using [**Mapbox Studio**](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/guides/).
To access Mapbox Studio, go back to your Mapbox account page and click "Create a map in Studio".

<img src="images/mapbox-studio-red-box.png" class="browser">

Next, create a new style.

<img src="images/new-style.png" class="inline">

From here, you are free to create a style however you'd like! As a starting point, many high quality map visualizations end up using a monochrome style, which you can find by clicking on "Classic template", then "Monochrome". Once you've selected a variant from the list of styles, click on the "Customize" buttom to add further customization, which will open up the actual studio, shown below.

<img src="images/mapbox-studio.png" class="browser">

Mapbox styles are made up of [layers](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/styles/#layers) and [components](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/styles/#components) (e.g. natural features, streets, points of interest, transit nodes, etc.). These items have properties which can be edited, such as the color or font, and can even be removed for a cleaner look.
For example, if you wanted to make the color of the bodies of water a more natural blue color in this monochrome example, you could click on the "Land & water _water_" layer in the left panel and simply adjust the color in the color picker.

<img src="images/mapbox-edit-property.png" class="browser">

Once you are done playing around with the style, you can [**publish it**](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/guides/publish-your-style/) so that it can be referenced in your code where you define the map, as you did in [Step 1.4](#step-14-create-the-map). To do so, click "Publish" in the top right corner of the studio interface.

Then, click on the three dots next to your style name to find the style URL (it will look something like this: `mapbox://styles/casillasenrique/clukyyerk007v01pb6r107k1o`).

<img src="images/copy-style.png">

Copy it and paste this URL in your `style` property when defining the `mapboxgl.Map` object. You should now see that your map uses your custom style!

<img src="images/studio-final-in-code.png" class="browser">

Now, each time you edit your map style in Mapbox Studio and re-publish it, the updated style will automatically be applied in your website (note that sometimes the style takes a couple of minutes to update after publishing).

## Step 2: Adding bike lanes

### Step 2.0: Getting familiar with the data

The City of Boston provides an [open dataset with bike lanes in the city](https://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/boston::existing-bike-network-2022.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D).
The dataset is in [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) format, which is just JSON that follows a specific structure, designed to represent geographical data.

Download the dataset, open it in VS Code, and examine its structure. This is your for you to look through the dataset yourself, but we can import the data through the link (demonstrated in step 2.1).

{: .tip }
Try pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the command palette, and then select “Format document” to make the JSON more readable.

### Step 2.1: Modify `map.js` to Wait for the Map to Load Before Adding Data

1. **Import the data**

Mapbox provides an `addSource` function to connect the map with an external data [source](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/sources/).
However, to use any of that, we first need to wait for the `"load"` event to fire on `map` to make sure the map is fully loaded before fetching and displaying the data:

```js
map.on('load', async () => {
  //code
});
```

2. **Adding the Data Source with `addSource`:**
   ```javascript
   map.addSource('boston_route', {
     type: 'geojson',
     data: 'https://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/boston::existing-bike-network-2022.geojson',
   });
   ```
   - **`boston_route`** is a unique ID for this data source.
   - The **data** is a link to Boston's open data in **GeoJSON** format, describing existing bike lanes.

{: .fyi }
What is `boston_route`?
It’s just a name we made up to refer to this data source.
You can name it anything you want, but it should be unique to this source.

This won’t produce much of a visible result.
To actually _see_ something, we need to actually _use_ the data to draw something.

3. **Visualizing Data with `addLayer`:**
   ```javascript
   map.addLayer({
     id: 'bike-lanes',
     type: 'line',
     source: 'boston_route',
     paint: {
       'line-color': 'green',
       'line-width': 3,
       'line-opacity': 0.4,
     },
   });
   ```
   - **`id: 'bike-lanes'`** is a unique identifier for the layer.
   - **`type: 'line'`** tells Mapbox we're drawing lines (perfect for bike lanes).
   - **`paint`** controls the visual styling:
     - `'line-color'`: The color of the lines (`green` in this case).
     - `'line-width'`: The thickness of the lines (set to `3`).
     - `'line-opacity'`: How transparent the lines are (`0.4` means 40% opacity).

### Step 2.2: Styling and Customization

1. Experiment with Layer Styles:

   You can tweak the appearance by adjusting the `paint` properties. Here's an example with different styles:

   ```javascript
   paint: {
     'line-color': '#32D400',  // A bright green using hex code
     'line-width': 5,          // Thicker lines
     'line-opacity': 0.6       // Slightly less transparent
   }
   ```

{: .caveat }
Mapbox does not yet understand newer color formats like `oklch()`.
You can see the [docs](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/types/#color) on what it accepts, but at the time of writing it's basically named colors (e.g. `green`), hex codes (e.g. `#32D400`), `hsl()` and `rgb()`.
You can convert any valid CSS color to the closest `rgb()` or `hsl()` equivalent using [this tool](https://colorjs.io/apps/convert).
If it shows two versions, you want the one marked "gamut mapped".

2. **Try Different Layer Types:**

   You can experiment with other **layer types** like `'fill'`, `'circle'`, or `'symbol'` depending on your data and goals. For bike routes, `'line'` works best.

If everything is set up correctly:

1. Your map will center on **Boston**, and you'll see the **existing bike network** visualized as **green translucent lines**.
2. You can **zoom in** to see more detail or **pan** around the city to explore the bike lanes.
3. Inspecting the map in **DevTools** will show the dynamically added layers and sources in the DOM.

<!-- ### Step 2.1: Import the data

Mapbox provides an `addSource` function to connect the map with an external data [source](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/sources/).
However, to use any of that, we first need to wait for the `"load"` event to fire on `map`.
To avoid nesting all our code in an event listener, we can instead convert our `onMount` function to an `async` function, and then add this after the map creation:

```js
await new Promise((resolve) => map.on('load', resolve));
```

After that we can add the source:

```js
map.addSource('boston_route', {
  type: 'geojson',
  data: 'https://bostonopendata-boston.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/boston::existing-bike-network-2022.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D',
});
```

{: .fyi }
What is `boston_route`?
It’s just a name we made up to refer to this data source.
You can name it anything you want, but it should be unique to this source.

This won’t produce much of a visible result.
To actually _see_ something, we need to actually _use_ the data to draw something.

### Step 2.2: Drawing bike lanes on the map

One way to do that is to use the [`map.addLayer()`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#addlayer) method to add a [_layer_](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/layers/) to our map that visualizes the data source.

The this will look like this:

```js
map.addLayer({
  id, // A name for our layer (up to you)
  type, // one of the supported layer types, e.g. line, circle, etc.
  source: 'boston_route', // The id we specified in `addSource()`
  paint: {
    // paint params, e.g. colors, thickness, etc.
  },
});
```

You should experiment with the different types of layers and paint properties to see what you can come up with, but chances are you’ll settle on `"line"`,
to draw a network of bike routes as lines.

Without any painting properties (i.e. an empty `paint` object),
your map will look like this:
![](images/routes-unstyled.png).

### Step 2.3: Styling the bike lanes

You should look at the [reference](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/layers/#layer-sub-properties) to see what you can do with the `paint` property, but chances are you will need at least the following:

- `line-color` to set the color of the lines (see caveat below)
- `line-width` to make the lines thicker (default is `1`)
- `line-opacity` to make the lines translucent (0 is fully transparent, 1 is fully opaque). This is recommended so that the lines blend in to the rest of the map smoothly instead of obscuring it.

{: .caveat }
Mapbox does not yet understand newer color formats like `oklch()`.
You can see the [docs](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/types/#color) on what it accepts, but at the time of writing it's basically named colors (e.g. `green`), hex codes (e.g. `#32D400`), `hsl()` and `rgb()`.
You can convert any valid CSS color to the closest `rgb()` or `hsl()` equivalent using [this tool](https://colorjs.io/apps/convert).
If it shows two versions, you want the one marked "gamut mapped".

{: .caveat }
Since these are properties in a JS object, and they contain hyphens, we need to wrap them in quotes, e.g. `"line-color": "green"`, not `line-color: "green"`.

The exact styling is up to you. I went with a translucent `green` (40% opacity), and a line width of `3`, which looked like this:

<img src="images/bike-lanes-green.png" class="browser" alt=""> -->

### Step 2.3: Adding Cambridge bike lanes

Notice that our map right now only shows bike lanes from Boston.
What about the numerous Cambridge ones?!

Fortunately, the City of Cambridge also provides [bike lane data as a GeoJSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambridgegis/cambridgegis_data/main/Recreation/Bike_Facilities/RECREATION_BikeFacilities.geojson).

Follow a similar process as steps 2.0 - 2.3 to visualize Cambridge bike lanes as well.
It should look like this:

<img src="images/cambridge-routes.png" class="browser" alt="">

{: .further }
At this point, you have likely ended up specifying your line styles twice:
one in the Boston layer, and one in the Cambridge layer.
This means that if we want to tweak them, we need to do it as many times as our layers.
A good idea at this point (but entirely optional) is to specify the styling as a separate object that you reference in both places.

## Step 3: Adding bike stations

As you probably know, [Bluebikes](https://bluebikes.com/) is a bicycle sharing program in the Boston area.
They make many [datasets](https://bluebikes.com/system-data) publicly available, including real-time and historical data.
The first Bluebikes dataset we will use in this lab is station information, which is a JSON file with names, IDs and coordinates (among other info) for each station.

We have made a copy of this data in <a href="data/bluebikes-stations.json" download markdown="1">`https://dsc106.com/labs/lab07/data/bluebikes-stations.json`</a>.
This is a JSON file with the following properties:

- `Number`: a code like "L32001"
- `NAME`: the station’s name, like "Railroad Lot and Minuteman Bikeway"
- `Lat`: the station’s latitude, e.g. 42.41606457
- `Long`: the station’s longitude, e.g. -71.15336637
- `Seasonal Status`: whether the station is seasonal or not with statuses like "Year Round", "Winter storage" etc.
- `Municipality`: e.g. "Cambridge", "Arligton", etc.
- `Total Docks`: the number of docks at the station as a number, e.g. 11

We will be using the latitude and longitude data to add markers to our map for each station.

While we _could_ use Mapbox’s `addSource()` and [`addLayer()`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#addlayer) functions to plot the stations as another layer on the map canvas (like we just did with bike lanes), we will try a different approach here so we can learn how to combine the two visualization methods we have already learned: Mapbox and D3.
We will be adding an SVG layer on top of our map to hold the station markers, and use D3 to fetch and parse the data, and to draw the markers.

**Import D3 as an ES Module**

Before using D3 functions, we need to import it as an **ES module** in `map.js`.

Add this **at the top** of `map.js`:

```javascript
import * as d3 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7.9.0/+esm';
```

### Step 3.1: Fetching and parsing the CSV

We need to ensure the map is fully loaded before fetching and displaying the station data. Again, we'll use the **`map.on('load', ...)`** event listener to achieve this. Place the following code **within** `map.on('load', async () => {}` chunk we created earlier.

```javascript
map.on('load', async () => {
  //previous code
  let jsonData;
  try {
    const jsonurl = INPUT_BLUEBIKES_CSV_URL;

    // Await JSON fetch
    const jsonData = await d3.json(jsonurl);

    console.log('Loaded JSON Data:', jsonData); // Log to verify structure
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading JSON:', error); // Handle errors
  }
});
```

1. map.on('load', async () => {...}) ensures that the JSON data is only fetched after the map is fully loaded and ready.
2. await d3.json(jsonurl) loads the JSON file asynchronously using D3.js, ensuring the script doesn't proceed until the data is fully loaded.
3. The jsonData variable holds the successfully loaded data, which is then logged to the console for verification.
4. The catch (error) {...} block properly handles errors (e.g., file not found, CORS issues, or incorrect JSON formatting) and logs them for debugging.
   Once the JSON file is loaded, we access the **nested stations array**. Based on your JSON structure, the station data is stored under `data.stations`.

```javascript
let stations = jsonData.data.stations;
console.log('Stations Array:', stations);
```

1. `jsonData.data.stations` navigates through the JSON object to retrieve the stations array.
2. `console.log('Stations Array:', stations);` helps you verify that the data is correctly accessed.

Check the Browser Console:

- Open Developer Tools in your browser (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console).
- You should see:
  - Loaded JSON Data: Displays the entire JSON structure.
  - Stations Array: Displays the array of station objects.

### Step 3.2: Overlaying SVG on the map

We will start by appending an `<svg>` element on our map container in our `index.html` file:

```html
<div id="map">
  <svg></svg>
</div>
```

If you preview your app right now, you won’t see anything different.
However, if you right click on the map, you should be able to see the `<svg>` element we just inserted in the dev tools:

<img src="images/svg.png" alt="">

However, it doesn’t have the right size: it’s just a small rectangle in the top left corner.
Worse yet, it’s actually rendered _under_ the map, which becomes obvious if we give it a background color:

```css
#map svg {
  background: yellow;
  opacity: 50%;
}
```

Let’s fix all of that, by applying the following declarations:

- `position: absolute` and `z-index: 1` so we can position it on top of the map (`z-index` does not work without positioning)
- `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` to make it fill the map container
- `pointer-events: none` so that we can still pan and move the map

Make sure you’re now seeing something like this:

![](images/svg-yellow.png)

And then you can remove the `background` and `opacity` declarations — they were only there as debugging aids, we don’t need them for the actual visualization.

### Step 3.3: Adding station markers

This step is similar to making the scatterplot in the previous lab:
we just need to append a bunch of circles to the SVG element, each representing a station.

The only tricky part here is positioning them so that they line up with the map.
Fortunately, Mapbox has a great built-in function [`map.project()`](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/api/10.0.0-beta.12/-mapbox%20-maps%20-android/com.mapbox.maps/-mapbox-map/project.html), which takes longitude and latitude values and returns the relative map coordinates in pixels.

{: .fyi }
Why not just use D3 scales for this?
`map.project()` takes into account many things: panning, zooming, even rotation.
It’s certainly _possible_ to calculate this manually, but it’s nontrivial.

1. Select the SVG element inside the map container

Before fetching data, we'll select the svg element inside the map container.

```javascript
const svg = d3.select('#map').select('svg');
```

2. Define a Helper Function to Convert Coordinates

We’ll create a helper function, `getCoords()`, that takes in a station object and converts its longitude (`lon`) and latitude (`lat`) into pixel coordinates using `map.project()`. Create this function outside of the `map.on('load',...)` aka globally so that it can be accessed anywhere in the script, including during map interactions like zooming, panning, and updating station positions dynamically.

```javascript
function getCoords(station) {
  const point = new mapboxgl.LngLat(+station.lon, +station.lat); // Convert lon/lat to Mapbox LngLat
  const { x, y } = map.project(point); // Project to pixel coordinates
  return { cx: x, cy: y }; // Return as object for use in SVG attributes
}
```

- `map.project()` handles all complexities like panning, zooming, and rotating, ensuring accurate positioning.

3. Load the JSON File and Append Circles

Back inside `map.on('load',...`, once the map has fully loaded, we'll append SVG circles for each station right after loading the JSON data, as implemented in Step 3.1.

```javascript
// Append circles to the SVG for each station
const circles = svg
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(stations)
  .enter()
  .append('circle')
  .attr('r', 5) // Radius of the circle
  .attr('fill', 'steelblue') // Circle fill color
  .attr('stroke', 'white') // Circle border color
  .attr('stroke-width', 1) // Circle border thickness
  .attr('opacity', 0.8); // Circle opacity
```

- The `enter()` selection binds the data and appends a `<circle>` for each station.
- You can adjust the radius (`r`), fill color, and opacity as needed.

At this point, you **won’t see any circles** on the map yet! That’s because we haven’t set their **x (`cx`) and y (`cy`) positions**.

Right now, the circles exist in the SVG but don’t have coordinates to place them correctly on the map.

4. Update Circle Positions When the Map Moves

We need to ensure the station markers stay aligned when the map pans, zooms, or resizes. We'll define an `updatePositions()` function to reposition the circles whenever the map changes. Place this code right beneath `const circles = ...`.

```javascript
// Function to update circle positions when the map moves/zooms
function updatePositions() {
  circles
    .attr('cx', (d) => getCoords(d).cx) // Set the x-position using projected coordinates
    .attr('cy', (d) => getCoords(d).cy); // Set the y-position using projected coordinates
}

// Initial position update when map loads
updatePositions();
```

- `cx` and `cy` attributes determine the position of the circles on the SVG.
- The `getCoords()` function ensures positions are recalculated based on the map's current viewport.

5. Add Event Listeners to Adjust Markers Dynamically

We'll listen to Mapbox events like `move`, `zoom`, and `moveend` to call the `updatePositions()` function whenever the map changes.

```javascript
//updatePositions(); <- previous code

// Reposition markers on map interactions
map.on('move', updatePositions); // Update during map movement
map.on('zoom', updatePositions); // Update during zooming
map.on('resize', updatePositions); // Update on window resize
map.on('moveend', updatePositions); // Final adjustment after movement ends
```

If everything went well, you should see something like this:

![](images/stations-static.png)

## Step 4: Visualizing bike traffic

Marking the station position is nice, but doesn’t tell a very interesting story.
What patterns could we uncover if we set the size of the circles according to the amount of traffic at each station?

A copy of the Bluebikes traffic data from March 2024 is at <a href="data/bluebikes-traffic-2024-03.csv" download markdown="1">`https://dsc106.com/labs/lab07/data/bluebikes-traffic-2024-03.csv`</a>.
This is quite a large file (21 MB) containing more than 260,000 entries with the following fields:

- `ride_id`: A unique id of the ride
- `bike_type`: `electric` or `classic`
- `started_at`: the date and time the trip started in ISO 8601 format (e.g. `"2019-12-13 13:28:04.2860"`)
- `ended_at`: the date and time the trip ended in ISO 8601 format (e.g. `"2019-12-13 13:33:57.4370"`)
- `start_station_id`: the ID of the station where the trip started (e.g. `A32000`)
- `end_station_id`: the ID of the station where the trip ended (e.g. `A32000`)
- `is_member`: whether the rider is a member or not (`1` or `0`)

This is a cut down / simplified version of the dataset that Bluebikes provides to reduce filesize.

### Step 4.1: Importing and parsing the traffic data

Similar to the previous step for the json url, we will use `await d3.csv()` to fetch the traffic data.
You can fetch it directly from the URL, without hosting it yourself.
Let’s call the variable that will hold the traffic data `const trips`.

### Step 4.2: Calculating traffic at each station

Now that we have read the data into a JS object, we can use it to calculate station traffic volumes (arrivals, departures, and total traffic per station).

As we have in the previous labs, we will use [`d3.rollup()`](https://d3js.org/d3-array/group#rollup) (or `d3.rollups()`) to calculate arrivals and departures.

First, we calculate them separately, like for `departures`:

```js
const departures = d3.rollup(
  trips,
  (v) => v.length,
  (d) => d.start_station_id,
);
```

Now, implement the same thing as above for `arrivals`.

{: .note }
We are calculating `departures` and `arrivals` inside `map.on('load', () => {` since we only need to calculate them once.

Now, we want to add `arrivals`, `departures`, `totalTraffic` properties to each station, which we can do like this after both `stations` and `trips` have loaded:

```js
stations = stations.map((station) => {
  let id = station.short_name;
  station.arrivals = arrivals.get(id) ?? 0;
  // TODO departures
  // TODO totalTraffic
  return station;
});
```

**Fill in the `// TODO` sections in the code chunk above to create departures and totalTraffic properties to each station in addition to the arrival property that is given.**

{: .tip }
You can log `stations` in the console after to make sure the properties have been added correctly.

### Step 4.3: Size markers according to traffic

Now, we can use this data structure to size the markers on the map according to the traffic at each station.
Currently, all our circle radii are hardcoded.
We should decide what the minimum and maximum radius should be (I went with `0` and `25`),
and then create a D3 scale to map our data domain `[0, d3.max(stations, d => d.totalTraffic)]` to this range of circle radii.

However, there is a catch: if we just use a linear scale to calculate the circle’s radius,
we will end up misrepresenting the data: for example, stations that have double the traffic would appear 4 times larger since the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius (A = πr²).
We want to use the circle _area_ to visualize the variable, not the circle _radius_.

To fix this, we will use a different type of scale: a [square root scale](https://d3js.org/d3-scale/pow#scaleSqrt).
A square root scale is a type of power scale that uses the square root of the input domain value to calculate the output range value.

Thankfully, the API is very similar to the linear scale we used before,
the only thing that changes is that we use a different function name:

```js
const radiusScale = d3
  .scaleSqrt()
  .domain([0, d3.max(stations, (d) => d.totalTraffic)])
  .range([0, 25]);
```

Then, we can use this scale to calculate the radius of each circle in the SVG by passing the station traffic as a parameter to `radiusScale()`.

We can then set the r (radius) attribute of an SVG <circle> using `d => radiusScale(d.totalTraffic)` which is an arrow function that takes the data object d (representing a single station) and passes its totalTraffic value into the radiusScale function.

If we look at our map right now, it looks like this:

![](images/station-traffic-1.png)

Because our dots are opaque and overlapping, it’s hard to see the actual traffic patterns.
Add a CSS rule for `circle` inside your `svg` rule, and experiment with different `fill-opacity` values and strokes to improve this.
I used a `steelblue` fill, a `fill-opacity` of 60%, and a `stroke` of `white`, and this was the result:
![alt text](images/stations-stroke.png)

### Step 4.4: Adding a tooltip with exact traffic numbers

In addition to providing additional info, it helps us debug as well to be able to see the number of trips that each circle represents.
_Please note here that tooltips take a a few minutes to render so be patient this one!_
We will be implementing tooltips with D3! When creating circles using D3, we'll append a `title` element inside each circle to display the total trips, arrivals, and departures. Make sure that `.each(function (d)){...}` goes after all previously defined circle attributes!

```javascript
const circles = svg
  .selectAll('circle')
  // all other previously defined attributes omitted for brevity
  .each(function (d) {
    // Add <title> for browser tooltips
    d3.select(this)
      .append('title')
      .text(
        `${d.totalTraffic} trips (${d.departures} departures, ${d.arrivals} arrivals)`,
      );
  });
```

- `.each(function(d) { ... })`: Iterates over each circle and appends a `<title>` element.
- `.text(`${d.totalTraffic} trips ...`)`: Sets the tooltip text to show total trips, departures, and arrivals.

We have applied `pointer-events: none` to the whole `<svg>`, so to be able to see our tooltips we need to override that on circles, by adding `pointer-events: auto` to our CSS rule for `circle`.

![](images/title-tooltip.png)

{: .further }
If you want to go even further, you could explore adding a nicer tooltip, with more advanced information.

## Step 5: Interactive data filtering

Even with the styling improvements, it’s hard to make sense of all this data as currently displayed all at once.
Let’s add some interactive filtering with a slider for arrival/departure time.

### Step 5.1: Adding the HTML and CSS for the slider

The first step is to add the HTML for our time filter, which includes the following elements:

- A slider (`<input type=range>`) with a min of -1 (no filtering)
  and a max of 1440 (the number of minutes in the day).
- A `<time>` element to display the selected time.
- An `<em>(any time)</em>` element that will be shown when the slider is at -1.
- A `<label>` _around_ the slider and `<time>` element with some explanatory text (e.g. "Filter by time:").

Where you put it on the page is up to you.
I added it under the `<h1>` and wrapped both with a `<header>`, to which I applied a `display: flex`, `gap: 1em`, and `align-items: baseline` to align them horizontally,
then gave the label a `margin-left: auto` to push it all the way to the right.

Make sure to place the `<time>` and `<em>` on their own line (e.g. via `display: block`) otherwise the contents of the `<time>` updating will move the slider and it will look very jarring.

You would also want to style the `<em>` differently, e.g. with a lighter color and/or italic, to make it clear that it’s a different state.

Here is a sample rendering of what you should have at this point:

<img src="images/slider-static.png" alt="" class="browser">

### Step 5.2: Reactivity

Now that we've added our static HTML and CSS, let’s connect it with our code
by having the slider update a variable that we can use to filter the data
and outputting the currently selected time in the `<time>` element.

We’ll use JavaScript to listen for slider input events and update `timeFilter` in real time.

We will select the slider and display elements Ainside map.on('load', ...), after the map event listeners we implemented previously:

```javascript
const timeSlider = document.getElementById('#time-slider');
const selectedTime = document.getElementById('#selected-time');
const anyTimeLabel = document.getElementById('#any-time');
```

Since the slider value represents minutes since midnight, we need to convert it to a formatted time (HH:MM AM/PM).

Now, we’ll create a **global helper function** (outside of `map.on()`) to format time properly.

```javascript
function formatTime(minutes) {
  const date = new Date(0, 0, 0, 0, minutes); // Set hours & minutes
  return date.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeStyle: 'short' }); // Format as HH:MM AM/PM
}
```

We'll write a function that:

- Updates `timeFilter` based on the slider's value.
- Shows the formatted time in the `<time>` element.
- Displays "(any time)" when no filter is applied (`timeFilter === -1`).

Then we can create a function to update the UI when the slider moves:

```javascript
function updateTimeDisplay() {
  timeFilter = Number(timeSlider.value); // Get slider value

  if (timeFilter === -1) {
    selectedTime.textContent = ''; // Clear time display
    anyTimeLabel.style.display = 'block'; // Show "(any time)"
  } else {
    selectedTime.textContent = formatTime(timeFilter); // Display formatted time
    anyTimeLabel.style.display = 'none'; // Hide "(any time)"
  }

  // Trigger filtering logic which will be implemented in the next step
}
```

Now, we need to bind the slider’s `input` event to our function so that it updates the time in real-time.

```javascript
timeSlider.addEventListener('input', updateTimeDisplay);
updateTimeDisplay();
```

<!-- It looks like this now:

![](images/slider.gif) -->

### Step 5.3: Filtering the data

Our slider now _looks_ like a filter, but doesn’t actually _do_ anything.
To make it work there are a few more things we need to do.

Firstly, since we **need to repeatedly compute station traffic**, it’s best to **extract** this logic into a separate function (aka we will refactor our code into a new function).
Right now, the logic for computing station traffic (arrivals, departures, and total trips) is inside `map.on('load', ...)`. This means every time we need to **recalculate traffic**, we would have to rewrite the same logic or duplicate code.

The new function should be **defined globally** (outside `map.on('load', ...)`) with the following content:

```javascript
function computeStationTraffic(stations, trips) {
  // Compute departures
  const departures = d3.rollup(
    trips,
    (v) => v.length,
    (d) => d.start_station_id,
  );

  // Computed arrivals as you did in step 4.2

  // Update each station..
  return stations.map((station) => {
    let id = station.short_name;
    station.arrivals = arrivals.get(id) ?? 0;
    // what you updated in step 4.2
    return station;
  });
}
```

What Does the Function Do?

1. Take `stations` and `trips` as arguments (so it works with any dataset).
2. Compute arrivals and departures\*\* using `d3.rollup()`.
3. Update each station with the calculated values (arrivals, departures, and total traffic).
4. Return the updated station data\*\* so it can be used elsewhere.

Inside `map.on('load', ...)`, instead of computing everything inline, we **call** the new function like this:

```javascript
const stations = computeStationTraffic(jsonData.data.stations, trips);
```

It should replace the previous stations variable created in step 3.1 as shown below:

```javascript
let stations = jsonData.data.stations;
```

Next, the trip data includes dates and times stored as strings, which can't be directly compared to the number of minutes since midnight used in our slider.

To fix this, we need to convert the date and time strings into JavaScript [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) objects so we can work with them numerically.

Instead of modifying the data separately after loading, we update each trip directly within the d3.csv() import.

This ensures that every trip's started_at and ended_at values are converted as soon as they are loaded.

Inside `map.on('load', ...)`, **we'll use the second argument of `d3.csv()` to parse the date strings into `Date` objects**, ensuring they are correctly formatted as soon as the data is loaded:

```js
//within the map.on('load')
let trips = await d3.csv(
  'https://dsc106.com/labs/lab07/data/bluebikes-traffic-2024-03.csv',
  (trip) => {
    trip.started_at = new Date(trip.started_at);
    trip.ended_at = new Date(trip.ended_at);
    return trip;
  },
);
```

Now, we can define a helper function that takes a `Date` object and returns the number of minutes since midnight:

```js
function minutesSinceMidnight(date) {
  return date.getHours() * 60 + date.getMinutes();
}
```

Then, we can use this function in another function to filter the data to trips that started or ended within 1 hour before or after the selected time:

```js
function filterTripsbyTime(trips, timeFilter) {
  return timeFilter === -1
    ? trips // If no filter is applied (-1), return all trips
    : trips.filter((trip) => {
        // Convert trip start and end times to minutes since midnight
        const startedMinutes = minutesSinceMidnight(trip.started_at);
        const endedMinutes = minutesSinceMidnight(trip.ended_at);

        // Include trips that started or ended within 60 minutes of the selected time
        return (
          Math.abs(startedMinutes - timeFilter) <= 60 ||
          Math.abs(endedMinutes - timeFilter) <= 60
        );
      });
}
```

Next, to dynamically update the scatterplot based on the selected time filter, we will **create a function called `updateScatterPlot()`** and ensure that it is called whenever the slider value changes.

Inside `map.on('load', ...)`, add the following function:

```js
function updateScatterPlot(timeFilter) {
  // Get only the trips that match the selected time filter
  const filteredTrips = filterTripsbyTime(trips, timeFilter);

  // Recompute station traffic based on the filtered trips
  const filteredStations = computeStationTraffic(stations, filteredTrips);

  // Update the scatterplot by adjusting the radius of circles
  circles
    .data(filteredStations)
    .join('circle') // Ensure the data is bound correctly
    .attr('r', (d) => radiusScale(d.totalTraffic)); // Update circle sizes
}
```

Place this Inside `map.on('load', ...)`, **after** `updateTimeDisplay()` has been defined.
This function will:

- Filter the trip data based on the selected time.
- Recompute station traffic using the filtered trips.
- Update the circle sizes to reflect the new traffic values.

After defining `updateScatterPlot()`, update `updateTimeDisplay()` so it **calls `updateScatterPlot(timeFilter)` whenever the slider value changes**.

Modify `updateTimeDisplay()` as follows:

```js
function updateTimeDisplay() {
  let timeFilter = Number(timeSlider.value); // Get slider value

  if (timeFilter === -1) {
    selectedTime.textContent = ''; // Clear time display
    anyTimeLabel.style.display = 'block'; // Show "(any time)"
  } else {
    selectedTime.textContent = formatTime(timeFilter); // Display formatted time
    anyTimeLabel.style.display = 'none'; // Hide "(any time)"
  }

  // Call updateScatterPlot to reflect the changes on the map
  updateScatterPlot(timeFilter);
}
```

Now, `updateScatterPlot(timeFilter)` is called every time the slider changes to update the scatterplot dynamically. The filtering logic is now separate from the visualization logic, making the code cleaner and easier to manage and circle sizes update in real-time to reflect the new trip data filtered by time.

To ensure that **D3 properly reuses existing circle elements** instead of unnecessarily destroying and recreating them, we need to **set a key for the `.data()` calls**.

Currently, `.data(stations)` and `.data(filteredStations)` do not specify a key, meaning D3 does not track which circles correspond to which stations across updates. By **using a key (`d.short_name`)**, D3 will match data points to existing elements efficiently.

We will update **two locations** in the code:

1. When initially creating the circles inside `map.on('load', ...)`.
2. When updating circles inside `updateScatterPlot()`.

Inside `map.on('load', ...)`, locate the following code where we create the circles:

```js
const circles = svg
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(stations)  // Current code
  .enter()
  .append('circle')
  ...
```

Modify it to use a **key function**:

```js
const circles = svg
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(stations, (d) => d.short_name) // Use station short_name as the key
  .enter()
  .append('circle');
```

Again, the **key function `(d) => d.short_name`** ensures that D3 keeps track of circles corresponding to each station. Without this key, D3 might delete and recreate elements unnecessarily, reducing performance.

Next, inside `updateScatterPlot()`, locate this code:

```js
circles
  .data(filteredStations)  // Current code
  .join('circle')
  .attr('r', (d) => radiusScale(d.totalTraffic))
  ...
```

Modify it to also **use a key function**:

```js
circles
  .data(filteredStations, (d) => d.short_name) // Ensure D3 tracks elements correctly
  .join('circle')
  .attr('r', (d) => radiusScale(d.totalTraffic));
```

We want to **change the range of our circle size scale (`radiusScale`)** depending on whether filtering is applied. This ensures that circles appear **larger when fewer trips are shown** and remain **smaller when displaying all trips**.

Currently, our circles always use the same size range `[0, 25]`. When we **filter trips by time**, fewer trips will be displayed. To ensure stations remain visible and proportional, **we increase the maximum circle size when filtering**. This is done by **modifying the `.range()` values** of `radiusScale` based on `timeFilter`.

We will **update the `updateScatterPlot()` function** to modify the `radiusScale.range()` dynamically.

Insert this line before updating the circles and after defining filteredStations:

```js
timeFilter === -1 ? radiusScale.range([0, 25]) : radiusScale.range([3, 50]);
```

If **no filtering is applied (`timeFilter === -1`)**, the circle sizes use the default range `[0, 25]`. If **filtering is applied**, the **minimum and maximum sizes increase** to `[3, 50]`, making circles more prominent. This ensures that even with fewer data points, stations **remain visible and properly scaled**.

The result right now should look like this:

### Step 5.4: Performance optimizations _(optional ONLY if you don't have this problem)_

Notice that moving the slider now does not feel as smooth as it did before we implemented the filtering.
This is because every time we move the slider, we filter the trips, which is a relatively expensive operation given that we have over a quarter of a million of them!
Worse, every time we do this filtering, _nothing else can happen_ until the filtering ends, including things like the browser updating the slider position!
This is commonly referred to as _"blocking the main thread"_.

There are many ways to improve this.
[_Throttling_ and _debouncing_](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/) are two common techniques to limit the rate at which a certain (expensive) piece of code is called in response to user action.

These are "brute force" in the sense that they work regardless of what the expensive operation or the user action is, but they can adversely affect the user experience, since they make the UI update less frequently.
However, depending on the case, there are often ways to optimize the operation itself (e.g. by caching repetitive work), without any negative impact on the user experience.

In this case, we can make the filtering a lot less expensive by presorting the trips into 1440 "buckets", one for each minute of the day.
Then, instead of going over 260 K trips every time the slider moves, we only need to go over the trips in the 120 buckets corresponding to the selected time.

We start by defining two top-level variables to hold the departure and arrival "buckets",
which will be arrays with 1440 elements initially filled with empty arrays:

```js
let departuresByMinute = Array.from({ length: 1440 }, () => []);
let arrivalsByMinute = Array.from({ length: 1440 }, () => []);
```

Why 1440?

- There are **1440 minutes in a day** (24 × 60).
- Each index in `departuresByMinute` represents a specific **minute of the day**.
- This allows us to quickly look up and filter trips based on their departure time.

Inside `map.on('load', ...)`, where we already convert `trip.started_at` and `trip.ended_at` into `Date` objects in `let trips = await d3.csv(...)`, we **add trips into their respective minute buckets**.

```js
let startedMinutes = minutesSinceMidnight(trip.started_at);
//This function returns how many minutes have passed since `00:00` (midnight).
departuresByMinute[startedMinutes].push(trip);
//This adds the trip to the correct index in `departuresByMinute` so that later we can efficiently retrieve all trips that started at a specific time.

// TODO: Same for arrivals
```

**Make sure to do the same for arrivals as departures in the //TODO part**

Next, we are **removing `filterTripsByTime`** and introducing a **more efficient approach** by implementing `filterByMinute()` and updating `computeStationTraffic()` to work with this new filtering method.

Previously, `filterTripsByTime(trips, timeFilter)` **looped through all trips** and checked if each trip started or ended within 60 minutes of `timeFilter`. This approach **required filtering a large array** every time the slider moved, leading to **unnecessary computation** on each update. As the dataset grows, filtering every trip on every update becomes a major performance issue.

Instead of **iterating over all trips**, we use **`departuresByMinute` and `arrivalsByMinute`** created in the previous step. These **pre-grouped trip lists** allow us to **instantly access trips** within a time window, without scanning the full dataset.

`filterByMinute()` efficiently **retrieves only the trips** that fall within **60 minutes before or after** the selected time. It operates directly on **precomputed time-based arrays** (`departuresByMinute`, `arrivalsByMinute`) and **normalizes the time range** using the **modulus (`%`) operator**, handling cases where time filtering crosses midnight. The function is outlined below:

```js
function filterByMinute(tripsByMinute, minute) {
  if (minute === -1) {
    return tripsByMinute.flat(); // No filtering, return all trips
  }

  // Normalize both min and max minutes to the valid range [0, 1439]
  let minMinute = (minute - 60 + 1440) % 1440;
  let maxMinute = (minute + 60) % 1440;

  // Handle time filtering across midnight
  if (minMinute > maxMinute) {
    let beforeMidnight = tripsByMinute.slice(minMinute);
    let afterMidnight = tripsByMinute.slice(0, maxMinute);
    return beforeMidnight.concat(afterMidnight).flat();
  } else {
    return tripsByMinute.slice(minMinute, maxMinute).flat();
  }
}
```

Now we must refactor `computeStationTraffic()`. The original function **filtered trips directly** based on `filterTripsByTime()`, which was inefficient. Instead, we now **pass the `timeFilter` to `filterByMinute()`**, which **retrieves trips instantly**.

```js
function computeStationTraffic(stations, timeFilter = -1) {
  // Retrieve filtered trips efficiently
  const departures = d3.rollup(
    filterByMinute(departuresByMinute, timeFilter), // Efficient retrieval
    (v) => v.length,
    (d) => d.start_station_id
  );

  const arrivals = d3.rollup(
    filterByMinute(arrivalsByMinute, timeFilter), // Efficient retrieval
    (v) => v.length,
    (d) => d.end_station_id
  );

  // Update station data with filtered counts
  return stations.map((station) => {... //previously implemented no updates
  });
}
```

Lastly, we have to update all calls to `computeStationTraffic()` to use the new `timeFilter` parameter instead of passing the entire trips dataset. This ensures that station traffic calculations are based on **pre-filtered trip data** rather than scanning all trips manually.

Updating the first call to `computeStationTraffic()`:

**Before (Old Code)**

```js
const stations = computeStationTraffic(jsonData.data.stations, trips);
```

- `trips` was passed in, requiring the function to **filter trips manually**.
- This approach was **redundant and inefficient**, since filtering was being performed multiple times.

**After (Updated Code)**

```js
const stations = computeStationTraffic(jsonData.data.stations);
```

- Now, `computeStationTraffic()` **handles trip filtering internally**.
- The function automatically defaults to `timeFilter = -1`, meaning **all trips are used initially**.

Updating `updateScatterPlot()`:

**Before (Old Code)**

```js
const filteredTrips = filterTripsbyTime(trips, timeFilter);
const filteredStations = computeStationTraffic(stations, filteredTrips);
```

- `filterTripsbyTime()` was used to filter trips before passing them into `computeStationTraffic()`.
- This approach **duplicated filtering logic**, slowing down performance.

**After (Updated Code)**

```js
const filteredStations = computeStationTraffic(stations, timeFilter);
```

- Instead of pre-filtering trips, we now pass `timeFilter` directly.
- `computeStationTraffic()` **retrieves trips efficiently** using `filterByMinute()`.
- This reduces redundant filtering and speeds up updates.

If everything goes well, it should now look like this:

## Step 6: Visualizing traffic _flow_

Currently, we are visualizing traffic volume at different times of the day, but traffic direction also changes!
In the morning, stations in downtown and near MIT campus tend to have a lot of arrivals, while in the evening they tend to see a lot of departures.

In this step, we will use circle color to visualize traffic flow at different times of the day.

### Step 6.1: Make circle color depend on traffic flow

While it may seem that using a continuous color scale gives us more information,
humans are very poor at associating continuous color scales with quantitative data
(as we will see in the upcoming Color lecture),
so using only three colors will actually make the traffic flow trends more salient.

To do this, we will use a [_quantize scale_](https://d3js.org/d3-scale/quantize), which is like a linear scale but with a discrete output range.
We will use this scale to map a continuous number from 0 to 1 to a discrete number in the array `[0, 0.5, 1]`.
It looks like this:

```js
let stationFlow = d3.scaleQuantize().domain([0, 1]).range([0, 0.5, 1]);
```

Then, on our circles, we calculate the ratio of departures to total traffic,
map it to our discrete scale, and assign the result to a CSS variable. You can implement this style with the following code:

```js
const circles = svg
  .selectAll('circle')
  // previous code implemented ommitted for brevity
  .style('--departure-ratio', (d) =>
    stationFlow(d.departures / d.totalTraffic),
  );
```

We also need to add this within our `updateScatterPlot()` function:

```js
function updateScatterPlot(timeFilter) {
  // previus code ommitted for brevity
  circles
    // previus code ommitted for brevity
    .style('--departure-ratio', (d) =>
      stationFlow(d.departures / d.totalTraffic),
    );
}
```

Then, in our CSS rule for `circle` we can use this variable to set the fill color:

```css
--color-departures: steelblue;
--color-arrivals: darkorange;
--color: color-mix(
  in oklch,
  var(--color-departures) calc(100% * var(--departure-ratio)),
  var(--color-arrivals)
);
fill: var(--color);
```

If everything went well, our current map looks like this:

<video src="videos/traffic-flow.mp4" loop muted autoplay></video>

### Step 6.2: Adding a legend

Our visualization looks pretty cool, but it’s very hard to understand what the three colors mean.
We can fix this by adding a legend to the map.

Let’s first add some HTML for the legend _after_ our map container:

```html
<div class="legend">
  <div style="--departure-ratio: 1">More departures</div>
  <div style="--departure-ratio: 0.5">Balanced</div>
  <div style="--departure-ratio: 0">More arrivals</div>
</div>
```

There are many ways to style this as a legend, but the following apply to most of them:

- Move the `--color-departures`, `--color-arrivals`, and `--color` variables to a new rule so that it applies to both `#map circle` and `.legend > div`.
- Apply flexbox to the legend container to align the items horizontally.
- Apply `margin-block` to the legend container to give it some space from the map.

Here are some example styles and a few pointers on how to implement them, but you’re welcome to experiment and come up with your own design:

#### Design 1: Blocks

![](images/legend-blocks.png)

One advantage of this is that it generalizes more nicely to more than 3 colors,
and it’s fairly simple.

- Here each child `<div>` has `flex: 1` to make them take up equal space.
- The gap is only `1px`; just enough to prevent the colors from touching.
- Note that `text-align` is different for each swatch.
- Specify significantly more horizontal padding than vertical, otherwise they will not look even
- If you have used different colors, make sure to pick the text color accordingly to ensure sufficient contrast.

#### Design 2: Separate swatches & labels

![](images/legend-swatches.png)

This is a little more advanced but looks much more like an actual legend.
One downside of it is that it’s harder to generalize to more than 3 colors,
as it looks like a legend for a categorical variable.

- Uses a [`::before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) pseudo-element with `content: ""` to create the swatches.
- Uses an additional element for the "Legend:" label
- Each child `<div>` _also_ uses flexbox
- Make sure the gap on child `<div>` is _significantly_ smaller than the gap on the parent `.legend` to create the effect of the swatches being connected to the labels ([design principle of _proximity_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/gestalt-proximity/)).

Here is the final result:

## Step 7: Add your new project to your list of projects!

Now that you have made this cool app to visualize bike traffic in the Boston area, time to claim credit for your work!
Go back to your portfolio website, and add a new entry for this project, with a nice screenshot.

You should also add a `url` field to each project, and add a link to it in the template (for projects that have a `url` field).
