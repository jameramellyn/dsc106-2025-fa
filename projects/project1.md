An expository article requires the author to investigate an idea, evaluate
evidence, expound on the idea, and set forth an argument concerning that idea
in a clear and concise manner.

In this assignment, you will design an expository visualization to clearly
communicate an idea based on a small data set. In addition, you must provide a
rigorous rationale for your design choices. You should in theory be ready to
explain the contribution of every pixel in the display towards your expository
goals. You are free to use any graphics or charting tool you please - including
matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau, and pen and paper.

## Data: Grocery Store Foods

The foods stocked by grocery stores strongly influences consumer decisions
and dietary health. Here, you will examine a dataset of over 50,000 food items
sold by Walmart, Target, and Whole Foods that categorizes items based on their
degree of processing, price range, and nutritional content.

[**The dataset can be downloaded here.**][dataset]

The data has the following columns:

- `name`: The name of the food product.
- `store`: The store where the product is sold (Walmart, Target, or Whole Foods).
- `category`: The food category of the product.
- `brand`: The brand of the product.
- `FPro`: The Food Processing Score, a value between 0 (minimally processed) to
  1 (highly processed), as calculated by the GroceryDB authors using a random
  forest model.
- `FPro_class`: The predicted NOVA classification for the food. 0 = Unprocessed
  or minimally processed foods; 1 = Processed culinary ingredients, 2 =
  Processed foods, 3 = Ultra-processed food and drink products.
- `price`: The price of the product.
- `price percal`: The price per calorie.
- `package_weight`: The weight of the package in grams.
- `Protein`: Protein content.
- `Total Fat`: Total fat content.
- `Carbohydrate`: Carbohydrate content.
- `Sugars, total`: Total sugar content.
- `Fiber, total dietary`: Dietary fiber content.
- `Sodium`: Sodium content.
- `Cholesterol`: Cholesterol content.

The nutrition data (protein, fat, carbs, sugar, fiber, sodium, and cholesterol)
is normalized to grams per 100g of product.

This dataset is a simplified version of the GroceryDB dataset, which was
originally developed to make information about food processing accessible and to
guide consumers toward less processed food choices. More information about the
dataset can be found in their [Nature Food paper][paper]. You might also find
their website [TrueFood.Tech](http://TrueFood.Tech/) helpful. For more
information on the NOVA classification system, see pages 4-6 of the [NOVA
paper](https://worldnutritionjournal.org/index.php/wn/article/view/5/4).

## Task

Your task is to design a single static (i.e., single image) visualization that
you believe effectively communicates an idea about the data, and provide a short
write-up (no more than 4 paragraphs) describing your design. Start by choosing
one important takeaway you'd like the readers of your visualization to learn.
**Design your visualization to persuade readers of that takeaway, and use the
takeaway as the title of your graphic**.

While you must use the data set given, you are free to transform the data as
you see fit. Such transforms may include (but are not limited to) log
transformation, computing percentages or averages, grouping elements into new
categories, or removing unnecessary variables or records. You are also free to
incorporate additional external data. **Your chart image should be
interpretable without needing to reference your write-up**. Do not forget to
include title, axis labels, or legends as needed!

As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, your
write-up should document what aspects of the data you are attempting to most
effectively communicate. In short, what story are you trying to tell? Just as
important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured due to your
visualization design.

Your write-up should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions.
Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the
data and your specific question. These decisions include the choice of
visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as
the use of sorting or other data transformations. How do these decisions
facilitate effective communication?

## Grading

The assignment score is out of a maximum of 10 points. The expected median
score on this assignment is an 8.5, which corresponds to an A-. We will
determine scores by judging both the soundness of your design and the quality
of the write-up. We will also look for consideration of audience, message, and
intended task. Here are examples of aspects that may lead to point deductions:

- Use of misleading, unnecessary, or unmotivated graphic elements.
- Missing chart title, axis labels, or data transformation description.
- Missing or incomplete design rationale in write-up.
- Ineffective encodings for your stated goal (e.g., distracting colors,
  improper data transformation).

Your project will get 8.5/10 points if you fulfill all the requirements in the
project description. You'll get higher than 8.5 points if you go above and beyond
the project requirements, up to 10 points. We'll possibly give even higher than
10 points if the work is truly exceptional (e.g. could be published in a
popular news article). From our perspective, the project description tells you
how to get a passing grade on the project — if you followed the description and
published your work as part of a portfolio, it would be considered good quality
work by an outside reviewer (e.g. a professional data scientist), but probably
wouldn't be outstanding or memorable. Getting a 8.5/10 on the project grade
reflects that.

Projects that go "above and beyond" the assignment requirements to produce
effective graphics may include, for example, outstanding visual design,
meaningful incorporation of external data to reveal important trends,
exceptional creativity, or effective annotations and other narrative devices.

### Rubric

The assignment is out of 10 points possible. Submissions that squarely meet the
project requirements (Satisfactory column) will get 8.5/10 points.

| Annotations                | In addition to the Satisfactory requirements, the plot contains appropriate and helpful annotations (e.g. text, coloring, shading) that draw the reader's attention to the most relevant parts of the data. (+2.5 points) | The plot's title contains an interesting research question or takeaway; the axes have clear, human-readable labels with units; and a legend is present if appropriate. (+2 points)                                                                                                                             | One or more of the required annotations are missing (e.g. a title that describes the plot rather than an interesting takeaway, axes use auto-generated labels from data columns, etc.).

(+1.5 points) | The visualization used an inappropriate set of data transformations (e.g. filtering out important outliers), or did not clearly describe these transformations to the reader. (+1 point)            |
| Writeup                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The writeup clearly describes the motivation for the visualization and the rationale for its design decisions (e.g. the visual encodings, data transformations, color palette, etc.). It also contains an overview of the development process. (+2 points)                                                     | One or more required elements of the writeup has major issues (e.g. rationale misses important parts of the visualization design) or is missing.
