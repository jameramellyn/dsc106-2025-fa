## Overview

The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, and deploying interactive visualizations. Your project should address a concrete visualization challenge and should propose a novel, creative solution. The final deliverable will take the form of an explorable explanation, deployed as an interactive web page. Project teams should consist of 3-4 people. You may choose to continue with the same teams as Project 3 as well.

In addition to your webpage, you will be responsible for presenting your final results. At the end of the quarter we will have a video showcase for you to share your work.

Prior to diving in, it is helpful to gain a sense of what goes into formulating a successful visualization project and to beware of common pitfalls. We encourage you to read [A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation by Tamara Munzner][link].

## Explorable Explanations

Your task is to create an Explorable Explanation: an interactive article that explains a complex subject to the reader. The dataset needs to be picked from the same list as Project 3. Focus on creating one or more interactive diagrams interlinked with explanatory text or annotations. We urge you to focus on a highly visual and/or interactive experience, as opposed to expecting a viewer to read large amounts of article text.

### What if I don’t want to visualize climate or satellite data?

To give more flexibility for final projects, in this quarter's offering of DSC
106, we will allow teams to propose projects that visualize datasets that are
**not** from Project 3 (including datasets outside the climate or environmental domain).
Interested teams must submit their Final Project Proposal by the due date (no
slip days allowed) and specify the following details in addition to the Proposal
requirements:

1. The dataset that you wish to visualize. This dataset must be publicly
   available and have at least 100 rows and 5 columns of data. The data
   **cannot** be synthetic or simulated.

2. A 3-4 sentence paragraph about why this dataset will make for an interesting
   final project.

If your team submits a proposal that doesn't use a dataset from Project 3, the
instructor will either approve or deny your proposal. If your dataset is
approved, you may proceed with your final project using your chosen dataset. If
your dataset is denied, you must use a dataset from Project 3 -- no second
chances! Note that the dataset decision won't affect your proposal grade: you
can receive full credit for the proposal even if your proposed dataset is denied
as long as you fulfill the requirements.

## Project Milestones

The final project consists of the following milestones:

- **Team Formation Form (Fri 11/14, 1:00 pm, No Slip Days)**. Submit the Team Formation Google Form to register your team for the final project. Every team must submit this form — even if you are continuing with the same team from Project 3.
Anyone who is not part of a team or has not submitted the form by Friday, November 14 at 1:00 PM will be randomly assigned to a team. This is a strict deadline and no excuses will be made. Complete the registration form (one per team., [Registration Link][link8])

- **Proposal (Tue 11/18, 11:59pm, Can Use Slip Days)**. Propose your chosen topic, dataset(s), and team members. We need the following information in the project proposal:

  - Project Title
  - Dataset
  - Brief writeup of what you intend to do (5-10 lines)
  - 5-6 static visualizations on your dataset

Apart from the team registration form, please also submit the Gradescope assignment for the proposal.

- **Initial Prototype (Tues 11/25, 11:59pm, Can Use Slip Days)**. Develop an initial prototype of your project and, similar to Project 3, publish it using GitHub pages. This prototype will be used by the course staff to provide feedback on your designs. It is expected that your project will not yet be in a "complete" state; however, by this point you should have the structure of your project laid out, rough prototypes of your main visualization(s) and interactions, and at least basic descriptive text. Each team should submit the URL for their project on Gradescope.

- **Demo Video (Tues 12/02, 11:59pm, Can Use Slip Days)**. You must produce a demo video (not to exceed 2 minutes in length) that introduces and explains your project. Your video can take the form of a narrated demo of your project, and may include additional content as you see fit. More information about preparing the video is available in the project deliverables section.

- **Deliverables (Mon 12/08, 11:59pm)**. Publish your final project web page and updated demo video. You may make final touches to your page after any feedback from our video session. More information about preparing the final deliverables is available in the project deliverables section.

- **Final Project Showcase (Tues 12/09, 11:30am-2:30pm)**. We will host a showcase for DSC 106 on Tue 12/09, 11:30am-2:30pm. All students are required to attend the showcase.

## Project Deliverables

To complete your final project, you must provide two primary deliverables, both
due Monday 12/08, 11:59pm:

- A demonstration video (<= 2 minutes in length) that communicates your project goals and visualizations. This video can be similar to the demo video that you previously submitted but should be updated to reflect the final version of your website.
- An interactive web page that visualizes your chosen topic.

### Online Visualization

Your final project visualizations must be published on GitHub pages. For your visualizations you need to use D3.js. Keep your source code (HTML markup, visualization JavaScript code, etc.) in the top-level of your GitHub repo.

### Video Presentation

In addition to your interactive web page, each team must produce a short demonstration video (no longer than 2 minutes!) introducing your project. Your video must communicate the specific topic and goals of your project along with your visualization designs. We expect most videos will use a mixture of static slides and interactive screen capture with overlaid narration. You should show your web page as published on the web. We recommend minimizing text in favor of spoken narration, bringing more focus and screen space to your visualizations. The initial frame of your video should include your project name and the team members' names.

Be sure that your video communicates how your visualization designs enable a better understanding of your chosen data. Do not simply enumerate the various features you implemented: focus on what viewers can learn from your visualization(s).

Please carefully read the [video production guide][video] for details on how to design and record your video. Your videos should be in MPEG4 (.mp4, .m4v) format. Use appropriate compression to ensure your video file is not unnecessarily large. You will post videos online, so we encourage you to put your best face forward to the world!

Your demo video must be published on YouTube. In addition you must submit a URL linking to your video via Gradescope by Tues 12/02, 11:59pm. We will have a video showcase during our final lecture session.

Please do not enable the option for YouTube Kids while uploading the video as it can't be added to playlists.

(+0.5 points) |
| **Motivation**                       | The video explains the motivation for your project – why do you think your visualization is better than other explanations? E.g. what does your visualization allow that other explorables don’t? (+2 points)                                                             | The video explains the motivation for your project but doesn’t explain what your project does better than other explanations.

(+1.5 points) | The explanation of the visualization does not sufficiently demonstrate its features. (+0.5 points)          |
| **Takeaways**                        | The video ends with an interesting takeaway and explains why your visualization demonstrates this takeaway effectively. What is the one thing that everyone should learn from your visualization? And why does your visualization succeed at explaining it? (+2.5 points) | The video ends with a takeaway message but the presentation could be improved (e.g. the takeaway isn’t surprising, or focuses too much on the implementation of the visualization). (+1.5 points)        | The video does not end with a takeaway message. (+0.5 points)                                               |

(+1 point)                                                                                                                                                            | The project doesn’t open with a hook (e.g. it immediately shows a visualization without explanation). (+0 points)                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Storytelling**                            | The project tells a compelling story. It follows the and-but-therefore structure and also incorporates elements of surprise, personalization, or emotion. (+3 points)         | The project tells a story – it follows the and-but-therefore structure. (+2 points)                                                                                                                                                                                     | The project does not tell a story (e.g. it doesn’t follow the and-but-therefore structure or something similar). (+1 point)                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Visual Encodings**                        | The project visualizations do not violate the expressiveness criteria and the design choices (marks and encoding channels) are clear, evocative, and effective. (+3 points)   | The project visualizations do not violate the expressiveness criteria, but another set of design choices (marks and encoding channels) could have been more effective (e.g. using the area visual channel instead of position when possible). (+2 points)               | The project visualizations violate the expressiveness criteria (e.g. heavy overplotting, encodings that imply incorrect readings, etc.), and these violations are not addressed using the available interactions (e.g. overplotting that cannot be filtered or zoomed into). (+1 point) |
| **Interaction**                             | The interactive elements of the project are polished, bug-free, and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data or the concept being explored. (+3 points) | The interactive elements of the project are functional and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns, but a static plot (perhaps with a different encoding) could have conveyed the same information just as effectively. (+2 points)                          | The plot would have been substantially more effective as a static plot without the interaction; or, the interaction has major bugs that preclude use. (+1 point)                                                                                                                        |

(+1 point)                                                                                                                                   | The visualizations contain no annotations.

What is the one thing that everyone should learn from your project? And why does your project succeed at explaining it? (+2 points)           | The project is missing a takeaway, or ends with a takeaway message but the presentation could be improved (e.g. the takeaway isn’t surprising, or focuses too much on the implementation of the visualization). (+1 point)                                                              |

The video explains the most interesting features, surprising features, or most challenging features to implement. (+2 points)                 | The explanation of the visualization doesn't mention its most interesting or surprising features, omits important features, or doesn't match up with the final version of the project.

What is the one thing that everyone should learn from your visualization? And why does your visualization succeed at explaining it?
